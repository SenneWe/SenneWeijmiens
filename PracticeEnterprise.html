          <h2>Bluesky Unlimited</h2>

          <p>
            So what is Bluesky Unlimited? It is a small made-up company that negotiates, buys and sells cargo space on
            airplanes. It then provides a centralised platform where you can find available cargospace from many diffrent airlines, all in one place. Customers can then very easly buy cargo space for their shipments on this platform.
            For this company to function, there where several things that needed to be set-up: ICT infrastructure, Software, AI tools and much more.
            <br>
            <br>
            All students from the second phase Electronics-ICT participated to this project, and together we brought the Practice Enterprise to life.
            It served as a testbed for our skills, enabling us to refine our abilities in the realm of IT.
            Throughout this venture, teamwork and creativity were the driving forces behind our success.
