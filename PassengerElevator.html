            <h1>Passenger Elevator</h1> 
            <p class="expl_txt">During my final year in Electromechanics at the Londerzeel Municipal Technical Institute (GTIL), I had the opportunity to work on an exciting integrated project. Assigned by our teacher, Witse, Mathis, and I were tasked with perfecting and bringing to life a miniature passenger elevator. The project spanned the entire school year, involving planning, construction, programming, and collaboration across different disciplines.</p>

            <h2>Team collaboration</h2> 
            <p class="more_expl_txt">Working alongside Witse and Mathis, our roles were crucial to the project's success. Witse focused on the weld construction, creating a 3D STL drawing with precise measurements. This construction formed the base for our elevator, complete with wheels for mobility. Mathis, skilled in programming, took charge of the Beckhoff PLCs and structured text language, ensuring the elevator's functionality and implementing vital safety features. My responsibility lay in crafting meticulous electrical drawings using EPLAN, setting the foundation for the wiring process.</p>

          <div class="expl_block">
            <h2>Execution</h2> 
            <p class="more_expl_txt">With the groundwork laid, a sixth-year student in electrical installations translated my electrical drawings into a functioning electrical cabinet. My task then was to connect the elevator's sensors and actuators to the designated terminals within the cabinet. It was a collaborative effort that highlighted the necessity of teamwork and learning on the job. This project served as our introduction to PLCs, programming, and EPLAN, pushing us to develop new skills and work seamlessly together.</p>

          <div class="expl_block">
            <h2>Technical Details</h2> 
            <p class="more_expl_txt"> The elevator boasted an array of sensors and actuators to ensure optimal performance and safety. Inductive sensors verified closed doors, reflective sensors prevented obstructions, and limit switches safeguarded against crashes. A pneumatic valve controlled door opening, solenoids locked the doors securely, and a precise stepper motor handled cabin movement. Additionally, we incorporated buttons and lights inside the cabin and on each floor for user convenience.</p>

        <div class="expl_block">
          <h2>Outcome and Future Improvements</h2> 
          <p class="more_expl_txt">The culmination of our efforts resulted in a successful and fully operational elevator. Satisfied with our achievement, we provided suggestions for potential enhancements, laying the groundwork for future iterations of the project. The experience not only sharpened our technical skills but also emphasized the importance of collaboration in tackling complex engineering challenges.
